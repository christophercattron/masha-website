            <p>One of Masha's favorite pasttimes is photography. She doesn't use fancy techniques, or know her camera's inside-and-out, but she has an eye for beauty. She has a vision for what others might not see.</p>

            <p>All alone and just barely over 8 years old, Masha began treatment for her cancer at the hospital in Vladivostok. Though she was classified as an intermediary risk group, she was given a more intense treatment meant for high risk patients which notably included more intense chemotherapy and cranial radiation. The hospital where she was treated was notoriously unsatisfactory: unkempt, stale dry air, dirty, dilapidated, harsh medical staff, and most notably infested with cockroaches. In December 2006, after 106 weeks of fierce fighting, intense suffering, and lonely treatments, Masha completed the last stage of her cancer treatment. This brave, resilient 10 year-old girl had beat cancer.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>After being adopted and brought to the United States, Masha's doctors were surprised to read the details of her treatment. They were astonished at the intensity of her treatment, noting that the measures taken were usually reserved for high-risk patients. It wasn't until Masha was older that she read more and learned that she was actually a part of a medical study based on the Moscow-Berlin 2002 treatment protocol, which was carried out at clinics across Russian and Belarus between 2002 and 2008 to investigate the efficacy of a treatment protocol for ALL in children and adolescents. The study found that patients in the intermediary risk group experienced better outcomes when given the high-risk treatment, despite its increased intensity and toxicity. Masha's experience as a cancer patient while an orphan in Russia was deeply traumatizing to say the least, but it fostered a deep curiosity and fascination about the human body, cancer, and medicine. Her battle and subsequent curiosity instilled a passion and deep motivation to the enter the medical field.</p>

            <p>In April 2004, at the age of seven, Masha became very sick. She was fatigued, feverish, dizzy, and nauseous. Masha was still living at home with her mama when she became sick, and Mama was already battling a severe case of tuberculosis (that would ultimately end up taking her life). Masha has memories of Mama treating her with homemade folk remedies such as drinking pepper-infused vodka or—Masha's personal favorite—boiling a pot of potatoes underneath a blanket and inhaling the fumes. Due to her own declining health and inability to give Masha the care she needed, in August 2004, Mama made the difficult decision to take Masha to a social rehabilitation center for minor children, where she could receive the treatment and care she needed. Mama told Masha “I will come back for you”. Masha remembers being shaved bald and placed into a scalding hot bath upon admission to the center. She has eerie memories of this place… After some difficulty and delay in diagnosing Masha, she was eventually transferred to the Regional Children's Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Vladivostok where she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p>

Due to her own declining health and inability to give Masha the care she needed, in August 2004, Mama made the difficult decision to take Masha to a social rehabilitation center for minor children, where she could receive the treatment and care she needed. Mama told Masha “I will come back for you”. Masha remembers being shaved bald and placed into a scalding hot bath upon admission to the center. She has eerie memories of this place… After some difficulty and delay in diagnosing Masha, she was eventually transferred to the Regional Children's Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Vladivostok where she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p>

          <p>All alone and just barely over 8 years old, Masha began treatment for her cancer at the hospital in Vladivostok. Though she was classified as an intermediary risk group, she was given a more intense treatment meant for high risk patients which notably included more intense chemotherapy and cranial radiation. The hospital where she was treated was notoriously unsatisfactory: unkempt, stale dry air, dirty, dilapidated, harsh medical staff, and most notably infested with cockroaches. In December 2006, after 106 weeks of fierce fighting, intense suffering, and lonely treatments, Masha completed the last stage of her cancer treatment. This brave, resilient 10 year-old girl had beat cancer.</p>

          <p>After being adopted and brought to the United States, Masha's doctors were surprised to read the details of her treatment. They were astonished at the intensity of her treatment, noting that the measures taken were usually reserved for high-risk patients. It wasn't until Masha was older that she read more and learned that she was actually a part of a medical study based on the Moscow-Berlin 2002 treatment protocol, which was carried out at clinics across Russian and Belarus between 2002 and 2008 to investigate the efficacy of a treatment protocol for ALL in children and adolescents. The study found that patients in the intermediary risk group experienced better outcomes when given the high-risk treatment, despite its increased intensity and toxicity. Masha's experience as a cancer patient while an orphan in Russia was deeply traumatizing to say the least, but it fostered a deep curiosity and fascination about the human body, cancer, and medicine. Her battle and subsequent curiosity instilled a passion and deep motivation to the enter the medical field.</p>

          <p>In April 2004, at the age of seven, Masha became very sick. She was fatigued, feverish, dizzy, and nauseous. Masha was still living at home with her mama when she became sick, and Mama was already battling a severe case of tuberculosis (that would ultimately end up taking her life). Masha has memories of Mama treating her with homemade folk remedies such as drinking pepper-infused vodka or—Masha's personal favorite—boiling a pot of potatoes underneath a blanket and inhaling the fumes. Due to her own declining health and inability to give Masha the care she needed, in August 2004, Mama made the difficult decision to take Masha to a social rehabilitation center for minor children, where she could receive the treatment and care she needed.
